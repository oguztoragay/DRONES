(1) 12 Jan 2024: The model with 3 families was solved to optimality in  Time: 16.730475187301636 and the optimal objective function value is: 23.0

(2) 12 Jan 2024: A new script has been added to generate random instances of the problem based on the number of nodes and number of drones.

(3) 27 Jan 2024: The idea of having idle time for the drons have been implemented. A new branch has been created for SB small instance (capable of solving the model to optimality)

(4) 09 Apr 2024: The branches have been converted to folders in the main branch of the repository

(5) 31 May 2024: The _Combined_ branch includes all the models (MILP, NLP, Hexaly).
